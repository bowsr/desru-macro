A speedrunning-intended macro for DOOM Eternal that allows you to spam jump inputs without a freescroll mouse. 

# Downloading and installing

If you just want to get the macro, check the [releases tab](https://github.com/henyK/doom-eternal-macro/releases), and download the latest `DOOMEternalMacro.zip`. Extract the contents wherever you want, then run the exectuable.


# bindings.txt

The default binding to use this macro is `middle mouse button`. If you don't like using `middle mouse button` you can change it in `bindings.txt` to a different key code.

For a list of these key codes see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes).aspx).

Here are two example configurations:

 - Bind `middle mouse button` to spamming `wheel down`.
    - `4` or
    - `0x04` or
    - `0x04 Down`
 - Bind `middle mouse button` to spamming `wheel up`.
    - `0x04 Up` 

To use the macro in-game, just hold down the respective key for as long as necessary. The macro will continuously spam jump inputs, just as a freescroll mousewheel that you would keep spinning.


# Is this allowed in speedruns?

Currently all DOOM Eternal speedrun categories (Any%, 100%, All Collectibles) on the official leaderboard (https://www.speedrun.com/doom_eternal) allow this macro to be used. This is to level the playing field as quite a few glitches strongly benefit from using a freescroll mousewheel.
